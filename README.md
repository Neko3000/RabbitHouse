##So what is this?
A web application that I tried to bulid it looks like a Coffee Shop Website,<br>
including good information,news post,online orderer service....

##Why it only contains Index page?
It would be(supposed be!) completed soon(I guess<br>
if I needn't concentrate on some tests even do not konw where they appered in my life any longer.<br>
I realized how difficult to design a web app and bulid it by your own,especially the DESIGNING!<br>
But right now I believe even the Index should be rewriten again for this not so nice interface.I can't tolerate it.<br>

##Last
Actually,it already had been pubilshed in Auzre.<br>
